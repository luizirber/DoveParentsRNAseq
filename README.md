# Characterizing the neurogenomics of parental care in the rock dove

## Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for a collaboration between Drs. Rebecca Calisi and Matt MacManes that focuses on one characterizing the neurogenomocs of parental care in the rock dove.

## Organization

These repositories is broken down into the following sub-repositories, each with their own unique purpose and structure.

- **figures**: where figure generated by the scripts live. The prefix correspond to the script prefix that created the files
- **metadata**: contains files that describe the sample variables and a rosseta stone for transcripts to gene ids. 
- **results**: where data generated by the scripts live. The prefix correspond to the script prefix that created the files
- **scripts**: where the *.Rmd* script and the *.md* outputs live. The prefix corresponds to the order of operation. 

There are two hidden directories, `kallisto_mappings` and `mapping`, which contain the results of the kallisto and salmon algorithms that transform read counts into gene counts.
